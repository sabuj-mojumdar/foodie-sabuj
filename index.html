                <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Jolly, and this is my food blog. I love cooking. I love eating even more. It seems that
                    wherever I go recipes jump out at me and this blog is my place to record them. They are usually
                    quick and simple, mostly seasonal and always delicious. I hope you enjoy them as much as my family
                    and I do. </p>

                <p>Though most assume the Caesar salad has a connection to Julius Caesar, the popular salad was actually
                    created in Tijuana, Mexico, in 1924.</p>
